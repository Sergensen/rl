                        <h3>Liability for content</h3>
                        As a service provider we are responsible according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) for our own contents on these pages according to the general laws.
                        According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
                        <br />
                        Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected by this.
                        A liability in this respect is however only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete infringement.
                        As soon as we become aware of such infringements, we will remove the content immediately.

                        <h3>Liability for links</h3>
                        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties on whose contents we have no influence.
                        Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents.
                        The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of the linked pages.
                        The linked pages were checked for possible legal infringements at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking.
                        <br />
                        A permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement.
                        As soon as we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
                        <h3>Copyright</h3>
