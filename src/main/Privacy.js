                        1. Basic information
                        <br />Unless otherwise stated in the following sections, no personal data is collected, processed or used when using our websites.
                        <br />When you access our Internet pages, our Web servers automatically collect general information. This includes the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of the Internet service provider, the IP address of the computer used, the website from which you visit us, the pages you visit on our site and the date and duration of your visit.
                        <br />This data cannot be used by us to identify the individual user. We only evaluate the information statistically and use it exclusively to improve the attractiveness, contents and functionalities of our websites.
                        <br /><br />2. Personal Data
                        <br />In the basic EU data protection regulation (GDPR), personal data are defined as follows:
                        <br />All information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter “data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by assignment to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more special features that express the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                        <br /><br />3. Legal basis for the collection processing of personal data
                        <br />Insofar as we obtain your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of your personal data.
                        <br />When processing your personal data to fulfil a contract between you and RICHLIST, Art. 6 Para. 1 letter b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
                        <br />Insofar as the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.
                        <br />If processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.

The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires,unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.
