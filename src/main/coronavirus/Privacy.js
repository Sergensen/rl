<br /><br />2. Personal Data<br />
In the basic EU data protection regulation (GDPR), personal data are defined as follows:
All information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter “data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by assignment to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more special features that express the physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
<br /><br />
3. Legal basis for the collection processing of personal data<br />
Insofar as we obtain your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of your personal data.
When processing your personal data to fulfil a contract between you and this app, Art. 6 Para. 1 letter b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
Insofar as the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.
If processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.

Furthermore, data may be stored if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the person responsible is subject. The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires,unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.
